Figure: Treasury Supply Absorption Factor – a composite index of Treasury “safe asset” premium, constructed as the first principal component of multiple convenience yield measures (AAA credit spread, FX-hedged G3 sovereign spread, 10y swap-OIS spread, 2s30s swap spread). Higher values indicate Treasuries trading rich (higher convenience yield), while lower values indicate Treasuries cheap versus comparable instruments. The chart shows a marked downtrend since 2010, with the factor hovering around its lowest levels in 25+ years by 2024 ￼ ￼.
	•	Measuring the Convenience Factor: To quantify this, we use a Treasury Supply Absorption Factor (also called the convenience yield factor). It aggregates several market indicators of Treasuries’ relative value: for instance, the spread between AAA corporate bonds and Treasuries (adjusted for minimal default risk), spreads between FX-hedged foreign government bonds and Treasuries, and swap spreads ￼ ￼. Each of these captures an aspect of safe asset demand vs supply. By combining them (via principal component analysis), we extract a single factor that represents the overall richness/cheapness of Treasuries. A high factor = Treasuries are in high demand (yield spread vs others is low or negative – rich), and a low factor = Treasuries are yielding more relative to substitutes – indicating supply-demand imbalance where investors require extra yield to hold Treasuries ￼ ￼.
Result: Treasuries have steadily cheapened on a relative basis. Our factor (see figure above) shows a pronounced decline starting in the mid-2010s and hitting historically low z-scores by the mid-2020s ￼. In practical terms, this means that compared to, say, 2010, investors today get a much higher yield pickup from switching out of Treasuries into equivalent-duration alternatives. The convenience yield that Treasuries enjoyed in the past (thanks to scarcity and high liquidity preference) has largely evaporated. This aligns with fundamental drivers: public debt held by the market rose from ~30-40% of GDP in the early 2000s to ~70-80%+ of GDP recently ￼ ￼. Our data indeed show a clear negative relationship between debt levels and the convenience factor (Exhibit 3 in GS’s “Term Premium Reset” report plots this inverse correlation) ￼ ￼. In short, more Treasuries = lower convenience yield = higher term premium, all else equal.
	•	Institutional Demand Shifts: It’s worth noting that the convenience yield is also influenced by who’s buying. Post-GFC, regulations (Basel III, etc.) increased banks’ demand for high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) like Treasuries, which initially helped absorb some supply. Foreign official investors (like central banks of China, Japan) were big buyers in the 2000s but have become less dominant more recently (China’s reserves growth slowed, the Fed supplanted others during QE). The Fed itself was a huge buyer (QE1-3 and 2020 QE), temporarily boosting convenience yield by removing bonds from the private market. But now with the Fed in QT (quantitative tightening), those bonds are being handed back to the market. This regime change – from a net buyer (Fed) to a net issuer (Treasury) heavy environment – is a key reason the safe asset premium has flipped to a discount. An analogy: earlier, Treasuries were a limited-edition collector’s item; today, they’re more like an item on bulk sale – requiring a discount to clear. Indeed, as GS analysts note, Treasuries have cheapened on a relative basis post-GFC alongside rising public debt – a sign that the market is demanding additional compensation to absorb the supply ￼ ￼.
	•	Convenience Yield vs Term Premium: How does this connect to term premium? Essentially, a decline in convenience yield (Treasuries becoming cheap) should manifest as a higher term premium in observed yields. If investors aren’t willing to pay as much for the specialness of Treasuries, then Treasuries must offer more yield (risk premium) to attract buyers. Importantly, convenience yield is a cross-sectional concept (Treasury yield vs swap or vs another bond at the same maturity), whereas term premium is usually thought of as the excess yield on a Treasury over expected short rates. But if something affects Treasuries and not, say, interest rate swaps, it will show up as a higher term premium in term-structure models (since those models would attribute the extra yield to a risk premium). The Goldman Sachs research piece explicitly found that periods of Treasury cheapening correlate with rises in model-estimated term premium, especially in recent years ￼ ￼. As we’ll see next, since around 2016 the relationship between our convenience factor and the term premium has grown stronger – implying that supply/demand imbalances have become a major driver of the term premium, more so than in the early post-GFC years ￼.

In summary, the Treasury convenience yield is a critical structural underpinning of the term premium. The erosion of this convenience yield – thanks to mounting debt and declining liquidity preference – is at the core of the “Term Premium Reset” narrative. It answers why term premium is higher now: not merely because the economy or inflation expectations changed, but because the bond market’s plumbing (supply vs safe-haven demand) has shifted in a secular way. Next, we quantify how much of the term premium’s evolution can indeed be chalked up to these supply (and convenience yield) factors versus traditional macro drivers, across different regimes from QE to QT.

Attribution and Regime Evolution of Term Premium Drivers

A key goal of our research was to attribute movements in the term premium to different driving forces and see how those forces’ influence has changed over time. Specifically, we look at three categories: (1) Macro fundamentals (e.g. growth outlook, inflation, labor market slack, and associated uncertainty), (2) Pure supply-demand factors (Treasury debt issuance, Fed QE/QT – essentially captured by our debt metrics), and (3) Convenience/Safe-asset factor (the relative value of Treasuries we discussed). By constructing a multi-factor regression model for the 10yr term premium, we can estimate how much each factor contributes in various periods. We use a rolling window approach to see the regime shifts from the QE era, through the low-rate 2010s, the 2020 shock, and into the current QT era.
	•	QE Era (2010–2019): During the height of Quantitative Easing, the Fed actively suppressed term premiums. In this period, macro conditions were characterized by moderate growth and low inflation, and the Fed kept policy rates near zero for many years. Our attribution finds that macro fundamentals (particularly low inflation volatility and a negative output gap post-recession) accounted for much of the term premium decline. Term premium averaged high early in the period (coming out of the 2008 crisis it was >1%, see slide) but fell toward zero by mid-decade. Supply factors had a muted or even negative contribution – meaning despite rising debt, the Fed’s bond buying and global savings glut meant the market easily absorbed supply without demanding extra yield. Indeed, our model indicates that in the 2011–19 span, supply/convenience factors collectively pushed term premium down (contributing an average of about –0.1 in term premium, offsetting what little upward pressure debt created) while macro factors (anchored inflation, etc.) also kept term premium about ~0.5 percentage points lower【26†】. Effectively, during QE the abundant liquidity and strong demand for safe assets created a persistent positive convenience yield – Treasuries were rich, and term premiums stayed historically low. Investors in this era got used to the idea that long bonds barely paid any risk premium at all.
	•	Post-QE, Pre-COVID (2015–2019): After the Fed ended QE and even started a very gradual QT (2017–2019), we saw a transition. The term premium tried to normalize slightly (e.g. the Kim-Wright 10yr TP briefly went above 0% in 2018 when growth was strong and Fed hikes were ongoing). Our analysis shows that starting ~2016, the supply effect began to strengthen. Exhibit 4 from GS highlights that the sensitivity of term premium to our convenience yield factor became more negative (meaning when Treasuries cheapened, term premium rose more than before) ￼. This coincided with accelerating debt issuance (deficits widened in 2016–2019) and the Fed stepping back. Still, the macro side (low unemployment, anchored long-term inflation expectations) kept a lid on term premium overall. By late 2019, term premium was around zero – poised between opposing forces (gradually increasing supply pressure vs. still-benign macro expectations and some residual QE effects).
	•	COVID Shock and Response (2020–2021): The pandemic brought a brief spike in uncertainty (March 2020 saw a dash-for-cash that actually made Treasuries temporarily cheap amid liquidity stress), but then an overwhelming policy response. The Fed’s massive QE and emergency programs reintroduced a strong safe asset demand force – term premium plunged deeply negative in 2020 as the Fed bought trillions of Treasuries and investors sought safety. At the same time, fiscal supply exploded (deficits of 15%+ of GDP). Interestingly, our attribution for 2020–21 shows macro factors (recession, deflation scare) pushing term premium down ~0.45pp, while supply factors also appear to push it down (about –0.21)【26†】. How could supply increase coincide with term premium falling? Because the Fed essentially absorbed the supply (its balance sheet doubled) and investors’ liquidity preference spiked. In other words, the convenience yield temporarily spiked (Treasuries were extremely rich through much of 2020, evidenced by swap spreads blowing out and huge Fed purchase premiums). This underscores that context matters – in a crisis, even huge issuance doesn’t raise term premium if safe-haven demand and central bank intervention dominate. However, this state of affairs was artificial and reversed once the immediate crisis passed.
	•	QT and Fiscal Expansion Era (2022–2025): This is our current regime – and it is radically different from the prior decade. Coming out of the pandemic, inflation surprised to the upside, the Fed started hiking aggressively, and crucially, the Fed pivoted to Quantitative Tightening in mid-2022. At the same time, the U.S. government continued running large deficits (on the order of 5–7% of GDP) even in the recovery, meaning heavy Treasury supply. This combination – shrinking Fed balance sheet + big private-sector issuance burden – is essentially a stress test of the market’s absorption capacity. Our attribution analysis finds a sea change: supply and convenience factors now explain the majority of term premium movements, whereas macro factors have taken a back seat. In numbers, from 2022 to mid-2025, the model suggests macro fundamentals on net would have kept term premium quite low or negative (e.g. recession fears in 2022 meant, in isolation, term premium “wanted” to be low). But the supply-side pressures more than offset that, pushing the realized term premium up above model baseline. We estimate that roughly 75% of the variation in term premium over the last couple of years can be attributed to supply-related drivers (the debt level, the convenience yield shifts), a dramatic rise from perhaps ~10–20% in the early 2010s【26†】. In practical terms, the yield curve’s behavior is now strongly linked to the deficit and bond supply news flow – much more so than to, say, surprise data on inflation or growth, which used to dominate yield moves. This is why we’ve seen episodes like October 2023, where long-term yields surged almost independently of Fed policy signals (the Fed was actually hinting at being done hiking) – instead, it was fiscal alarm (big upward revisions to Treasury borrowing estimates) that drove the term premium spike.

To visualize this regime shift, imagine a stacked-bar chart of term premium attribution over time (as in our 3-year rolling model). Pre-2015, the “fundamental” bar (blue, say) was large and negative (tamping down TP) while the “supply” bar (red) was small. Post-2022, the red bar has grown to dominate, sometimes outweighing the blue. This aligns with GS’s finding that since 2016 the negative relationship between convenience yield and term premium has strengthened, indicating supply effects have become a bigger driver ￼.

It’s important to clarify that macro factors haven’t disappeared – they still matter, especially at shorter horizons. For example, rising inflation expectations or uncertainty does increase term premium (investors demand extra yield for inflation risk). Our model includes factors like the unemployment gap (tight labor market can raise inflation risk premium) and survey forecast dispersion (a proxy for uncertainty) ￼ ￼. These showed that the inflation scare of 2022 and the robust growth of 2023 did contribute to higher term premium. In fact, GS noted that much of the late-2024 term premium rise was fundamentally driven: about 23 bps of the increase in 2H 2024 was attributed to higher “spot” debt (supply), but the rest was due to macro factors (like growth and Fed path) since their convenience factor didn’t yet move much ￼ ￼. Thus, one insight is that the recent term premium reset has not been only about supply indigestion – it’s also about markets pricing in a resilient economy and sticky inflation (which raises the expected rate path and uncertainty).

However, when we contrast the US with Europe/UK, we see evidence of how supply can take center stage. In late 2023, the UK announced large fiscal plans (the “mini-budget” episode and subsequent budget revisions) and parts of Europe saw deteriorating fiscal outlooks. There, yields jumped largely via term premium with immediate widening of swap spreads (i.e. drop in convenience yield), clearly pinning the move on fiscal supply concerns ￼ ￼. In the US, by contrast, our analysis (and GS’s) suggests the mid-2023 term premium spike overshot fundamentals by a wide margin ￼ – it was a burst of supply fear that later partially retraced once the Treasury’s financing needs turned out slightly less dire than feared. This was seen in fall 2023: term premium jumped above the model-implied level (the model couldn’t fully explain it with macro and supply variables), marking a supply-driven overshoot ￼ ￼. That spike was short-lived (long yields actually fell back in November when some cooler inflation data and manageable auction results calmed nerves). But as GS notes, even that overshoot was “consistent with the eventual direction of travel given the debt trajectory” – essentially the market pulled forward some future term premium increase out of precaution ￼.

Takeaway: We are now in a regime where structural drivers (debt, Fed balance sheet, global safe asset demand) play as large a role – if not larger – than cyclical macro forces in determining the term premium. Once QE ended and the safe-asset convenience premium collapsed, the supply side became the tail wagging the dog. Our model’s average R² of ~76% indicates we can explain a lot of term premium variation by these quantifiable factors【26†】. It “says one thing: once QE ended and the safe-asset premium collapsed, supply now explains three quarters of every basis-point move in term premium, and the curve’s behavior is strongly linked to the deficit tape” (to quote our slide notes).

For asset allocators and researchers, recognizing this shift is crucial. It means watching fiscal policy and Treasury issuance updates is as important as reading the latest CPI print when it comes to anticipating bond moves. It also means traditional models that only consider growth/inflation might under-predict long-term yields if they don’t include a supply factor. In the next section, we examine how shocks in these different drivers propagate through the yield curve, using impulse response analysis to illustrate real-world scenarios like fiscal surprises or labor market shocks.

Impulse Response & Scenario Analysis (Shocks and the Yield Curve)

How would different macro or supply shocks impact the term premium and yields? We tackle this with a Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) framework, allowing us to simulate impulse response functions (IRFs) for term premium (and by extension the 2s10s curve) to various shocks. This exercise gives a sense of the timing, magnitude, and persistence of yield-curve reactions under different scenarios. We focus on three representative shocks: a Treasury supply absorption shock, a debt (fiscal) level shock, and a labor market (unemployment gap) shock, which together cover the structural and fundamental drivers we’ve discussed.

1. Shock to Treasury Supply Absorption (Convenience) Factor: This can be thought of as an abrupt change in the market’s appetite for Treasuries relative to supply – for example, a sudden fall in global safe-haven demand or a market technical event that causes Treasuries to cheapen (rise in yield) versus swaps. In our IRF analysis, a one standard deviation negative shock to the convenience factor (i.e. Treasuries become cheaper) leads to a gradual but persistent increase in term premium. The response is not a one-day jump, but rather builds over several weeks: we see perhaps ~5–8 bps increase in term premium accumulating over a 3-month horizon in the model. The peak effect might take a couple of quarters to be fully realized, reflecting that such structural re-pricing can be slow-moving but long-lasting. Put simply, a sustained drop in the safe asset premium doesn’t cause a sudden spike quite as much as it causes a trend drift upward in yields as investors continuously require a bit more yield to hold the growing supply. In the IRF chart (left panel in our slide), the term premium (blue line) rises steadily week after week, and shows little mean reversion even 6 months out – indicating the shock’s effect is largely permanent over our simulation window. This resonates with historical episodes where, for instance, a decline in foreign central bank buying or an increase in Treasury supply relative to GDP put a persistent upward pressure on long rates.

2. Shock to Debt/GDP (Fiscal shock): This scenario captures a sudden increase in the expected path of government debt – say a surprise deficit-financed spending package or a major upward revision to borrowing needs. Empirically, such news can hit the market in discrete jumps (think of a surprise CBO forecast showing much higher future debt, or an unanticipated fiscal stimulus bill). In our VAR, an abrupt 6 percentage point shock to the debt-to-GDP ratio (roughly a scale of, say, an extra $1.5–2 trillion in borrowing over a decade) produces a faster and initially larger impact on term premium than the convenience shock. The term premium reacts almost immediately – within days – because market participants foresee significantly more Treasury issuance in the pipeline and start demanding higher yields now. Our IRF (middle panel) shows a sharp uptick in term premium on impact, hitting a peak quickly (within 1–2 months). However, somewhat surprisingly, the magnitude of the instantaneous jump in term premium in our model is modest (on the order of 1–5 bps for a 1σ fiscal shock). The cumulative effect over time is more substantial – over 3–6 months the term premium might rise on the order of ~0.8 percentage points (80 bps) in response to a large fiscal shock, but that includes the gradual compounding of effects (each auction coming at higher yields, etc.). The key point from the metrics: debt shocks are the fastest and ultimately among the biggest movers of term premium. This aligns with intuition – if the market suddenly realizes the Treasury will flood it with bonds, yields adjust upward promptly. Historical example: the UK’s 2022 mini-budget, where just the expectation of heavy unfunded tax cuts caused 30-year gilt yields to explode higher by nearly 100 bps in days (though not all of that was pure term premium, it was a mix of term premium and credit concerns). In the US context, while changes in debt/GDP are usually gradual, market perceptions can shift rapidly (e.g., debt ceiling resolutions that signal more T-bill issuance can steepen the curve overnight). Our model suggests those effects, once incorporated, persist (the term premium doesn’t mean-revert down on its own) – it stays elevated unless counteracted by other forces (like Fed action or improved convenience demand).

3. Shock to Unemployment Gap (Macro/Labor shock): We use the unemployment gap (actual unemployment rate minus the estimated natural rate) as a proxy for the state of the economy relative to potential. A negative shock to the unemployment gap (i.e. unemployment falls or the gap closes – signaling a hotter economy) can stand in for an upside growth/inflation shock; a positive shock (higher unemployment) would be a downturn surprise. For our analysis, consider a shock that reduces the unemployment gap by 1.67 points (roughly unemployment dropping unexpectedly by that amount or NAIRU revising down) – this implies a suddenly tighter labor market and likely more inflationary pressure. The IRF (right panel) shows term premium jumping moderately at first (we get perhaps ~5 bps increase at peak). This makes sense: a stronger economy and tighter labor market raises inflation and rate uncertainty, thus investors demand a bit more term premium. However, interestingly the effect moderates over time – it doesn’t keep rising much beyond the first few months. In fact, the IRF curve flattens out and even hints at some reversal beyond 6 months. Why? Likely because a labor market shock would provoke an offsetting policy response (Fed tightening expectations increase, which flattens the curve and eventually reins in the economy). Also, some of the initial term premium rise might be front-loaded as markets price in the new information, then it stabilizes. Our summary bullets note: “Labor shock – macro tightening, moderates.” In other words, a boom or inflation scare will lift term premium, but since the central bank reacts to keep inflation in check, the longer-run impact is contained relative to a pure supply shock. Compare this to the fiscal shock where the Fed’s tool (short-term rate) can’t directly offset the need for higher long-term yields if debt is high – unless the Fed resorts to something unconventional like yield curve control (not likely in normal times).

Historical Context for Shocks: The most dramatic term premium shocks in recent memory have indeed been on the supply side, occasionally requiring central bank intervention. For instance, in March 2020, Treasury market dysfunction (a spike in yields amid forced selling) was essentially a negative convenience yield shock of >2σ magnitude. The Fed stepped in with unlimited QE to restore order – effectively overwhelming the shock with safe-asset demand from its balance sheet. Another example: the UK gilts crisis in 2022 was a fiscal shock that the Bank of England mitigated by temporary bond purchases. Our analysis echoes this – it notes that historically the largest shocks (>2 standard deviations) to term premia were supply-related, but were often cushioned by central bank support (QE). This raises a forward-looking question: in the current environment, how likely is it that a big supply shock could force the Fed’s hand again? Possibly if term premium surged too far, too fast (threatening financial stability or a deep recession), the Fed might pause QT or even intervene in long-end markets. That’s speculative, but it’s on allocators’ radar as a “tail scenario.” On the flip side, if a large negative shock hit (say a severe recession), we could see term premium collapse again (flight-to-quality and maybe Fed easing), though given the structural debt overhang, it might not go as deeply negative as in 2020.

Summary of IRF Insights:
	•	Debt/Fiscal shocks tend to cause quick, sizable, and persistent increases in term premium. Think of these as “step-change” jumps in the yield curve level (mostly affecting long-end), usually following a news event about government borrowing.
	•	Supply absorption (convenience) shocks cause a slow-burn upward drift in term premium. These could be structural trends (like gradual foreign selling or reduced bank demand) that accumulate over time. They might not spook markets on any single day, but they can materially raise yields over quarters if unchecked.
	•	Macro (labor/inflation) shocks still move term premium (especially if they alter perceived Fed trajectory or inflation risk), but their effects are moderated by policy reaction and often transitory relative to supply effects. These shocks influence both components: short-rate expectations and term premium, so the yield curve response can be complex (sometimes flattening if short rates jump more).

For portfolio managers, this scenario analysis reinforces the importance of scenario planning: e.g., “What if Congress passes a large spending bill?” vs “What if next year we hit a recession?” The former scenario might warrant positioning for higher long rates (shorting Treasuries or reducing duration) because term premium would likely climb. The latter might argue for adding duration (expecting term premium to fall with flight to safety). Also, understanding the time horizon of these effects is key – a supply-driven trend could hurt bond returns for many months (carry may not compensate if yields are grinding higher), whereas a one-off data surprise might be shrugged off after initial volatility.

Next, we turn to one of the most intriguing findings of our research: using the Treasury Supply Absorption factor as a forward-looking signal. By looking at extreme readings of this factor (quintiles), we can gauge when term premium (and the curve) might be prone to mean-reversion. This has direct application for timing allocation shifts.

Quintile-Based and Predictive Insights (Using Supply Factor as a Signal)

Markets have a way of overshooting and then correcting. The term premium, being partly driven by swings in sentiment and demand, is no exception. We investigated whether the Treasury supply absorption factor (our convenience yield proxy) has predictive power for future term premium moves. The idea: when Treasuries are extremely cheap (factor at a low extreme), perhaps the market has overpriced fiscal risks or underpriced the safe-haven demand, so subsequently the term premium might decline (meaning long yields fall relative to short rates). Conversely, if Treasuries are extremely rich (factor at a high extreme), maybe complacency is high and term premium could rise going forward.

To test this, we sorted historical data into quintiles based on the level of the supply absorption factor and examined the subsequent change in term premium (or 2s10s) over 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month horizons. The results indeed show a monotonic pattern:
	•	When the factor is in the lowest quintile (Treasuries very cheap, convenience yield very low), the term premium on average declines in the following months. In our analysis, the median 3-month forward change in term premium was around -5 to -8 bps when starting from Quintile 1 cheapness. At a 6-month horizon, the effect was even larger, e.g. roughly -9 bps median change (meaning term premium 6 months later was 0.09% lower) for the most extreme cheap cases【28†】. Intuitively, when the market was screaming “Too many Treasuries, not enough demand” at a peak of fear, those situations often saw some relief later – either because investors eventually stepped in to buy the dip, or policymakers reacted, or fiscal news improved. A recent real-world example: in October 2023, many indicators of Treasury cheapness hit extremes (the factor was very low, swap spreads very negative, etc.). In the next two months, term premiums actually eased a bit as year-end demand picked up and inflation data improved. Our quintile analysis captures such tendencies statistically.
	•	In contrast, when the factor is in the highest quintile (Treasuries very rich, convenience yield high), the term premium tends to increase subsequently. For Quintile 5 (most extreme rich episodes), we found term premium was higher by a few basis points 3 months out (e.g. median +3 to +5 bps), and even more by 6 months. Essentially, extremely rich Treasuries (like in early 2020 when everyone hoarded Treasuries) didn’t stay that rich – as conditions normalized, term premium rose (yields went up). Think of summer 2020: 10-year yields bottomed around 0.5% with deeply negative term premium; over the next year as the panic abated, term premium climbed and yields rose to ~1.5% by early 2021. Our data reflect that mean reversion.
	•	For middle quintiles (2–4), the subsequent moves are smaller, near zero on average, which makes sense – those are normal conditions without extreme mispricing.

We synthesized this into a forward-looking signal: When the Treasury Supply Absorption factor is at an extreme, it can be a contrarian indicator. Buy Treasuries (long duration) when the factor is extremely low (i.e. when everyone is shunning Treasuries and term premium is very elevated), because historically you’re likely to earn extra return as term premium subsides from those stretched levels. Sell/hedge Treasuries when the factor is extremely high (complacency and scarcity premium dominate), as there’s a good chance term premium will rise (hurting long-bond returns). This is akin to a value strategy on bond risk premium.

To quantify, our slide showed a bar chart of the impact of today’s factor on 3-month forward term premium change by quintile. Quintile 1 had a significantly negative average change (term premium fell), Quintile 5 had a positive change【28†】. We also plotted the term premium forecast error structure with and without the factor. Including the factor as a predictor improved forecasts – meaning this factor contains information not fully in the current term premium itself. The forward term premium changes under extreme conditions were on the order of 10–15 bps over 6 months (which is meaningful if you consider annual bond returns).

Currently (as of early 2025), the Treasury supply absorption factor’s “current reading” is around -1.7 z-score, which is near the cheap end (as shown by the red zone in the gauge on our slide). This suggests that the market is still quite concerned about supply (low convenience yield). Our model would interpret that as term premium being somewhat overextended on the upside – i.e., unless new shocks arrive, we could see some moderation (fall) in term premium if, for example, fiscal news is a bit better than feared or if demand (perhaps from pension funds or foreign buyers at these higher yields) comes back. In GS’s words, the market is “forward-looking in its fiscal concerns… which can keep back-end yields higher than spot conditions alone would suggest – but it also leaves a route to relief on benign news about the fiscal outlook” ￼ ￼. In plain language, that means if we got even a small positive surprise – say Congress passes some deficit reduction, or Treasury announces smaller auction sizes – we could see a snap-back rally in Treasuries (lower yields) because term premium would deflate somewhat from its elevated level. This asymmetry is useful for strategists: it tells us the risk/reward might favor looking for opportunities to go long duration on signs of fiscal improvement or if everyone is on one side of the boat regarding Treasury bearishness.

On the flip side, if the factor were to shoot up (say the Fed restarted QE or there was a global risk-off scramble for Treasuries), that might be a time to fade the rally and prepare for term premium to normalize higher later. Essentially, this factor can be part of a predictive toolkit: much like equity investors look at sentiment or positioning extremes, bond investors can monitor the convenience yield/supply absorption metrics.

One caveat: These are tendencies, not iron laws. For example, the factor could stay low for a prolonged period if deficits keep surprising to the upside continuously (you’d have a moving target). But generally, unless fundamentals keep worsening, an extremely low factor tends to revert. This predictive insight thus helps in forward-looking risk management – e.g. deciding how much term premium exposure to carry in the portfolio.

Summing up, Treasury supply absorption factor quintiles do provide a useful signal: extreme values anticipate the direction of term premium moves (and yield curve steepening/flattening) with a lead time of a few months. This is a valuable edge for asset allocators, who often need to position in advance of major shifts. It basically adds a contrarian mean-reversion lens to the earlier analysis.

We will now connect these findings to the broader macro context and current environment, and then discuss how investors can apply them via forecasting models and portfolio strategies.

Macro Implications and the Current Environment

The analysis so far has focused on mechanics and historical patterns. But what do they imply for the current macro-fiscal backdrop and the near-future trajectory of markets? Let’s tie the pieces together:
	•	U.S. Fiscal Trajectory: The United States is entering a period of persistently high public debt. Post-pandemic deficits have remained large (on the order of 6-7% of GDP in the latest fiscal year), and projections show debt-to-GDP rising in coming years absent policy changes. Simply put, Treasury supply will continue to be plentiful, and possibly grow even further if initiatives like infrastructure spending, defense outlays, or social programs expand without offsetting revenues. This means the Treasury Supply Absorption challenge is here to stay – the market will need to absorb trillions in new issuance each year. Our research suggests that, structurally, this will keep an underlying upward pressure on term premium. Even without any additional macro shocks, the baseline expectation should be for term premium to be higher on average in the next decade than it was in the previous decade, reflecting this heavier supply load.
	•	Federal Reserve’s QT and Policy Stance: The Fed is currently allowing its bond holdings to run off (QT), to the tune of up to $60B of Treasuries per month not being reinvested. This effectively adds about $720B annualized supply that private investors must take instead of the Fed – a significant quantity (though not all months hit the cap). The continuation of QT into 2024 means the largest single buyer of Treasuries (the Fed in 2020-21) is now a consistent net seller (or non-buyer). This regime is fundamentally different from the QE era, and it aligns with our finding that the convenience yield collapsed post-QE. Unless the Fed reverses course, this dynamic likely prevents term premium from reverting to pre-2022 lows. In fact, Fed officials have explicitly noted the rise in term premium and see it as helping tighten financial conditions for them ￼ ￼, implying they are not immediately inclined to intervene. Chair Powell and others have suggested that higher long-term yields (i.e., higher term premium) could lessen the need for further short-term rate hikes ￼ ￼, effectively letting the bond market do some of the work. This means the Fed is tolerating or even welcoming a moderate term premium increase. However, if term premiums were to overshoot too far (causing dysfunction or an unwarranted drag on the economy), the calculus could change. For example, a scenario where 10yr yields spike to, say, 6% primarily due to term premium might prompt the Fed to reconsider QT or use liquidity tools. For now, though, Fed QT + rising Treasury supply = double headwind for the convenience yield, and thus a tailwind for term premium.
	•	Potential Fiscal Cliffs or Policy Changes: One wildcard is the political/fiscal response. If at some point the U.S. embarks on deficit reduction (via spending cuts or tax increases), that could moderate the supply pipeline and alleviate some term premium pressure. Conversely, another round of fiscal expansion (for example, a large stimulus in a future downturn, or structurally higher defense spending) could amplify the pressure. There are also near-term events like debt ceiling standoffs (the U.S. came close to default in mid-2023 until the ceiling was raised). While a technical default was avoided, such episodes can paradoxically spur short-term market stress that affects certain maturities (T-bill yields spike) but also potentially increase term premium due to perceived higher U.S. fiscal risk. Our scenario analysis didn’t explicitly model a default scare, but it would be akin to a combination of a convenience shock (if Treasuries temporarily lose their risk-free aura) and a fiscal credibility shock. The 2011 debt ceiling fight, for example, resulted in S&P downgrading U.S. credit – yet Treasuries rallied hard in price (yields fell) because it triggered a risk-off wave. So, not all fiscal events lead to higher term premium in the short run; the context (risk sentiment) matters. However, the trajectory post-event usually resumes based on fundamentals: after 2011’s volatility, term premium resumed its downward drift thanks to Fed action; after 2023’s debt ceiling, term premium resumed climbing once the immediate crisis passed and the Treasury issued a flood of new debt. The implication: allocators need to be nimble around such events, knowing that term premium can swing, but the structural trend will reassert.
	•	Global Cross-Currents: While our focus is on the U.S., global factors do play a role in the U.S. term premium. For instance, what happens in Japan and Europe can spill over. The Bank of Japan’s yield curve control (YCC) policy has kept Japanese yields low for years, pushing Japanese investors to buy foreign bonds (including U.S. Treasuries) for yield pickup. Recently, the BoJ has been allowing its 10yr yield to rise more (YCC band widened, yields now ~0.8% in Japan). If Japanese yields become more attractive at home, Japanese funds might repatriate money, meaning reduced foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries – effectively a convenience yield shock (less global demand for the “safe asset” U.S. bonds). That would raise the U.S. term premium at the margin. Similarly, in Europe, higher inflation and the ECB’s own QT mean Bund yields are higher, competing for global fixed-income allocation. In late 2023, UK and European bonds sold off in part due to local fiscal concerns; U.S. Treasuries didn’t exist in a vacuum – there was a sympathy move. GS noted how Europe/UK saw term premium repricing on fiscal news ￼ ￼; if that trend of larger European deficits continues, global term premiums could remain elevated synchronously. On the other hand, if the U.S. term premium rises too much relative to other countries, international investors may step in. For example, if 10yr USTs at 5% yield far more than, say, German 10yr at 3%, global portfolios might shift to buy Treasuries, providing support. In Q4 2023 we saw some evidence of foreign buyers coming back when 10yr hit ~5%, which helped cap the rise. Thus, a global arbitrage channel can kick in: U.S. term premium doesn’t go to infinity because at some point it attracts sufficient foreign demand. But that “some point” might be higher now than historically, because currency-hedging costs for foreign investors can erode the yield advantage (when U.S. short rates are high, hedging USD back to EUR or JPY is expensive). This interplay is complex, but bottom line – global safe asset demand vs supply is a factor (think of it as affecting the convenience yield globally).
	•	Stock-Bond Correlation and Portfolio Impacts: Another macro implication of a higher, more supply-driven term premium is on the correlation between bonds and equities. In the 2010s, low term premium coincided with a regime of negative stock-bond correlation (bonds were great hedges for stocks, often rallying when stocks fell). In part, that was because deflationary shocks dominated and Fed support was expected – bonds would rally on bad news. Now, with fiscal and inflation risks more prevalent, we could see more instances of positive stock-bond correlation (as in 2022, when both stocks and bonds sold off together). Why? If the shock is something like excessive fiscal stimulus or an inflation surge, it can be bad for both bonds (higher term premium) and stocks (tighter financial conditions, higher discount rates). The convenience yield component also ties in: when Treasuries were ultra-scarce, any flight-to-quality would spike their price (negative correlation to stocks). With Treasuries plentiful and a bit “cheap,” a moderate risk-off might not produce the same strong bond rally unless it’s severe enough to re-awaken strong safety demand. For asset allocation, this means relying on Treasuries as a hedge is less straightforward – one might need additional hedges (derivatives or allocation to other uncorrelated assets) or to reduce overall risk when term premium is rising sharply. However, the flip side is higher bond yields mean better future returns – a boon for long-term investors (pension funds, etc.) who have been starved of yield. Many fund managers are now seeing 5%+ yields on high-quality bonds and finding them attractive additions, which could eventually help stabilize term premium (as that natural demand kicks in at sufficiently high yields).
	•	Feedback to Economy: It’s also worth mentioning the macro feedback loop: a higher term premium is tighter financial conditions, which can slow the economy (e.g., higher mortgage rates, costlier borrowing for businesses). The Fed often incorporates term premium moves into their assessment. If term premiums rise too far, it increases recession risk, which eventually would bring term premiums down (flight to safety). So there’s an inherent counter-cycle: the more term premium overshoots due to fiscal fears, the more it could sow the seeds of its own decline by weakening growth/inflation, prompting either market correction or Fed dovishness. This dynamic suggests that while the trend might be toward higher term premium, we may see oscillations and the authorities won’t allow an unbounded spiral upward.

In conclusion on macro implications, we are likely in a regime of higher average term premia courtesy of fiscal and quantitative tightening dynamics, but also one with potentially higher volatility in term premia as markets react to fiscal news and global shifts. Asset allocators need to monitor Treasury market technicals (like auction results, dealer inventories, foreign flows) almost as closely as payrolls or CPI releases. The traditional mantra “don’t fight the Fed” might be complemented by “don’t ignore the Treasury” – meaning, pay attention to the government’s financing as a market driver.

Having laid out the macro context, the final part of our presentation will focus on forecasting and practical applications: how can we use these insights in building models or making portfolio decisions?

Forecasting and Applications for Investors

Translating research into action, we discuss how portfolio managers and strategists at a firm like Fidelity can implement these findings. There are two angles: quantitative models/forecasting and qualitative strategy integration.

Quantitative Forecasting Models: One can construct relatively simple yet effective models to forecast term premium or related metrics (like the 2s10s spread or long-term yields) using the drivers we’ve identified. For example, a linear regression model for the 10-year term premium might include:
	•	The Treasury supply absorption factor (to capture relative supply/demand conditions)
	•	The level of debt-to-GDP (free float), perhaps orthogonalized to the above factor ￼ ￼
	•	Macro controls: unemployment gap, and measures of uncertainty like the dispersion of forecasts for growth/inflation (higher dispersion = higher term premium) ￼ ￼
	•	Perhaps a inflation risk indicator (if not already in forecast dispersion) and a monetary policy stance variable (like the 1y/3m OIS spread which captures expected easing/tightening).

GS’s model along these lines was able to explain the term premium movements post-2016 quite well, with only modest residuals ￼ ￼. In fact, as they noted, by early 2025 the actual term premium was only slightly above the model-implied (an overshoot, but “much less than in 2023” ￼ ￼). This kind of model can be used to project term premium under different scenarios: plug in a higher debt/GDP or a different convenience yield level and see what term premium it predicts. It effectively allows strategists to quantify, say, “If debt rises by X% of GDP and our convenience factor falls by Y, term premium should rise by Z bps, all else equal.” It’s a tool for scenario analysis and also for detecting mispricing. If actual term premium moves far above what the model suggests (like in late 2023), that might be a signal of overshooting – potentially a trading opportunity if one expects mean reversion (which did happen into early 2024).

We can also forecast the 2s10s curve or long-bond yields in a similar vein. A term structure model with a supply factor included (some research has done this ￼ ￼) could forecast yields by combining expected short rates (e.g., using fed funds futures or dot plots for the short end) plus a term premium component that follows a regression or factor process. For instance, one could forecast that over the next year, if unemployment rises (recession) and deficit stabilizes, term premium might fall by X bps, implying 10yr yields might drop even if the Fed doesn’t cut immediately. Conversely, if the economy stays hot and deficit widens further, term premium could add another Y bps, pushing long yields up.

Integrating Signals into Portfolio Strategy: On a more discretionary or qualitative level, there are several applications:
	•	Tactical Duration Positioning: Asset allocators can adjust their portfolios’ duration exposure based on term premium signals. For example, using the quintile signal discussed, if our supply factor is extremely low (Treasuries cheap, term premium likely to revert down), a fund-of-funds or multi-asset portfolio might add duration (e.g., extend the duration of their Treasury allocation or go long Treasury futures) to capitalize on the potential rally in bonds as term premium normalizes. Conversely, if Treasuries look extremely rich and term premium is very low, one might underweight duration or use derivatives to hedge against a rise in yields. This is essentially a mean-reversion trade on term premium.
	•	Risk Budgeting and Stress Testing: The insights can inform scenario stress tests. For instance, a risk manager might simulate a “fiscal shock” scenario (maybe 50 bps term premium jump) and examine the portfolio impact – finding that both bonds and equities might sell off. They could then decide to allocate some risk to assets that would hold value or rise in that scenario (e.g., cash, certain commodities, or strategies that short rates). If one knows the portfolio is vulnerable when term premium spikes, one could implement hedges for that (like payer swaptions, or a steepener trade that profits from long yields rising more than short yields).
	•	Macro Overlay / Relative Value Trades: A macro overlay team could use our factors to trade relative value across countries. For example, if U.S. Treasuries are very cheap (low convenience yield) while, say, German Bunds are not as cheap, one might go long Treasuries vs short Bunds expecting the spread to converge (term premium in U.S. to fall relative to Europe). Or if the U.S. convenience yield collapses further (meaning Treasuries super cheap), one might bet on swap spread tightening or on outperformance of Treasuries over swaps (as a way to capture an eventual rebound in convenience yield). These are more advanced strategies, but the principle is using this structural knowledge for cross-market arbitrage or mean reversion plays.
	•	Incorporating into Strategic Asset Allocation: On a strategic horizon, an allocator might reconsider the role of Treasuries. Now that term premium is positive again, expected returns on long Treasuries are higher going forward (just from carry and roll-down) than they were when term premium was negative. This could argue for holding a normal or even higher allocation to bonds for income purposes – you’re finally paid to hold duration. However, if that term premium is high because of inflation risk, then the correlation benefits might be weaker (as discussed). So one might split the difference: hold some Treasuries for income but complement them with other diversifiers (like inflation-linked bonds, gold, etc.). If one believes fiscal trends will worsen, one might also shorten the duration in core bond holdings (e.g., favor 5-year over 30-year bonds) to reduce vulnerability to term premium spikes.
	•	Opportunistic Trades Around Policy: The potential for policy intervention is also an angle. Suppose term premium shoots up and we suspect the Fed might respond (perhaps by ending QT early or doing operation twist). A savvy PM could anticipate that and position long bonds ahead of such a pivot (similar to how some anticipated BoE intervention in the gilts crisis). Conversely, if term premium is very low and we think the Fed will do QT acceleration (in an extreme hawkish scenario), that might be a time to get out of long-duration positions.
	•	Use in Communication and Macro Debate: Lastly, these insights can enhance internal discussions. For example, a portfolio team can debate: “Is the recent yield curve steepening telling us something about future growth (i.e., no recession coming) or is it just term premium? If it’s term premium (fiscal), maybe we shouldn’t read it as bullish for stocks.” This nuance is important – a term-premium-driven rise in yields is not the same signal as a growth-driven rise. In fact, it could be bearish if it tightens conditions. Our analysis helps in decomposing market moves, which in turn leads to better-informed allocation decisions (like not overreacting to a curve steepening as a pure signal of economic optimism if we know it’s fiscal).

In terms of concrete deliverables, we could envisage maintaining a “Term Premium Dashboard”: showing the current term premium (ACM/Kim-Wright), our supply absorption factor level (with historical percentile), debt metrics, etc., and providing an outlook (e.g., “Term premium is 50bps above post-2016 avg, supply factor near lows – base case expects some reversion unless new fiscal shocks; risk case if supply surprises, another 20bps upside.”). This could be updated quarterly for the allocation committee.

Another application is in deciding which funds or strategies to emphasize. For instance, strategies that benefited from falling yields (like long-duration or levered bond strategies) had a tough time when term premium rose in 2022. If one expects term premium to keep rising, one might shift to strategies that shorten duration or use rate hedges. Conversely, if one sees an overshoot and expects a decline, time to allocate to those duration-heavy strategies to capture the rebound.

Overall, the approach is to proactively integrate our term premium outlook into portfolio construction rather than reacting after the fact. This is what differentiates a forward-looking asset allocator.

Conclusion & Discussion

Key Takeaways: The Term Premium Reset theme highlights a structural change in bond market dynamics: after years of dormancy, term premium is again a dominant force in yields, driven by the twin forces of surging Treasury supply and waning investor demand for safe assets at ultra-low yields. We’ve shown that the 2s10s yield curve movement and term premium rise in the past year were not random – they reflect a fundamental repricing as the market adjusts to a new reality of larger deficits, quantitative tightening, and persistent inflation uncertainty.

For Portfolio Managers and Asset Allocation teams, a few core points stand out:
	•	The term premium is no longer an academic concept – it’s visibly impacting portfolio returns and asset correlations. Understanding its drivers (especially the supply absorption factor) is crucial for anticipating bond market moves.
	•	Regime shift: We’ve likely exited the “low term premium regime” (2009–2020) and entered a “higher term premium regime”. Strategies that thrived on ever-falling yields need recalibration, while those starved for yield now have opportunities.
	•	Supply matters like never before: Fiscal policy and debt management have become key market variables. The phrase “fiscal dominance” is sometimes used – while we’re not fully there, bond investors are clearly demanding fiscal discipline via higher yields. Watch budget announcements, auction schedules, debt ceiling debates – they feed directly into term premium now.
	•	Safe asset demand can’t be taken for granted: The convenience yield that kept Treasuries abnormally cheap is not assured. It can erode further if, for example, global central banks diversify reserves or if liquidity regulations are eased. Or, it could bounce back if, say, a recession triggers a flight to quality or if new structural demands (e.g., from pension funds for long assets) increase. We have to continuously assess this balance.

Open Questions / Discussion: We conclude by posing some strategic questions for debate, as this is an evolving story:
	1.	How high might term premium go? Historically, term premium was 1–2% in more “normal” times (and much higher in 80s). Could we be heading there? Our analysis suggests it’s possible if fiscal trends persist. However, each increment higher also raises the odds of a market or economic break (something the Fed/authorities might respond to). We should debate what an equilibrium term premium might be in a world of 100% debt-to-GDP and 2% inflation target – perhaps around 0.5–1.0%? Or do structural forces (global savings, etc.) still cap it below historical norms? ￼
	2.	What is the Fed’s tolerance? At what point would the Fed intervene if long rates keep climbing? They’ve so far indicated comfort with market-driven tightening. But if term premium overshoot starts causing serious stress (e.g., disorderly market functioning or threatens housing/financial stability), would they pause QT or even do targeted bond buys? This is speculative but important – if one believes a “Fed put” exists for the bond market, then betting on runaway term premium might be wrong.
	3.	Global ramifications: If U.S. term premium continues rising, how might that affect emerging markets or other assets? We already see higher U.S. yields exporting tighter financial conditions abroad (some EM countries faced outflows). Could this force global central banks to adjust (e.g., BoJ moving policy, or others doing QT slower)? In essence, is there a global constraint on U.S. term premium (because the U.S. is still the benchmark for global rates)? ￼
	4.	Stock-Bond Correlation Future: Will the 60/40 portfolio need rethinking if bonds sell off when stocks do (as in 2022)? Or will we revert to negative correlation if inflation is tamed? The answer may depend on what drives term premium – if supply and inflation risk remain main drivers, then positive correlation episodes may persist. That implies new diversification approaches (gold, alternatives, trend-following) might be more necessary.
	5.	Cross-asset and sector impacts: Higher term premium means a higher discount rate for all assets. Growth equity valuations, real estate cap rates, etc., all eventually adjust. Are our portfolios positioned for that? Also, within fixed income, steepening yield curves could favor certain trades (like curve steepeners, or TIPS if inflation risk is part of TP). Credit spreads might also widen if term premium is up (investors demand more spread on top of risk-free). There’s a lot to chew on here.

Final Word: The resurgence of the term premium is both a challenge and an opportunity. It challenges us to revisit paradigms formed in the low-rate era – reminding us that “there’s no free lunch” in holding long-term bonds; you must earn a premium for the risk. But it also offers opportunities for those who can understand the drivers and position accordingly – whether that’s exploiting mean reversion in overshoots, or reaping the higher income now available. By combining fundamental macro analysis with the structural supply perspective, we can better navigate this new landscape.

The floor is now open for discussion – we welcome questions on the analysis, and insights from the team on how we might further refine our approach or any counterpoints. For instance, do we believe the convenience yield might rebound due to regulatory changes or increased bank demand? How might political developments (e.g., a move toward fiscal austerity or conversely a huge new spending program) alter our view? And what signs would tell us that term premium is peaking versus just pausing? These are all areas rich for debate.

Thank you. The key takeaway is to stay vigilant and adaptable – the term premium is back, and it’s asserting itself in markets. By being proactive and data-driven, we can turn this from a risk into a source of alpha and strategic advantage.
