Treasury Supply, Term Premium, and Yield Curve Dynamics – A Spread-Based Perspective

Executive Summary (High-Level Overview)
	•	Project Overview: This research examines how Treasury supply and macro forces drive the Term Premium and yield curve dynamics, using yield curve spreads (e.g. 2s10s, 5s10s, 10s30s) as a proxy for term premium. The key innovation is a spread-based “relative richness” approach – analyzing which parts of the curve are cheap or rich – instead of relying solely on model-estimated term premia like ACM or Kim-Wright. This approach offers a more transparent gauge of term premium using observable market spreads ￼ ￼. (The Fed finds, for example, that a rise in the 10yr–2yr spread maps roughly one-for-one to a rise in term premium ￼ ￼, underscoring why curve spreads can proxy risk premia.)
	•	Why Now? The topic is timely given the recent bear steepening of the yield curve and a “Term Premium reset” in markets ￼. Over the past year, long-end yields spiked (even as front-end yields stabilized), suggesting a surge in term premium due to quantitative tightening (QT), large fiscal deficits, and rising Treasury issuance ￼ ￼. In the second half of 2023, 10-year yields jumped from ~4% to 5%+ primarily because term premia shot higher – a move fueled by the combo of Fed balance-sheet runoff, unexpectedly high Treasury debt issuance, and greater uncertainty about inflation/growth ￼. This pushed term premium to its highest in years, contributing to the curve steepening and refocusing investors on fiscal risks ￼ ￼. At the same time, the Fed’s rapid hikes had inverted the curve earlier; now the inversion is easing as long rates rise on supply-driven factors even while short rates peak. The confluence of post-pandemic deficits, Fed QT, and lingering inflation has made understanding term premium dynamics especially critical.
	•	Context – Fiscal and Market Backdrop: The U.S. is running large budget deficits (6–7% of GDP) even in a non-recession, meaning heavy Treasury supply is coming to market ￼. Unlike past recessions (when central banks cut rates and investors eagerly bought bonds, keeping yields low amid issuance), today we face massive issuance without central bank buying ￼ ￼. Investors are demanding more yield to absorb this supply – hence term premiums are “at decade highs” and yield curves have steepened ￼. This regime shift (from QE to QT, from low inflation to higher uncertainty) underpins the project’s “why now.” We connect the recent steepening to these macro forces and show how our spread-based approach can inform actionable portfolio insights (e.g. when long-term rates are overshooting fundamentals due to supply fears).
	•	Key Insight/Innovation: By using yield spreads to infer relative richness, we sidestep some limitations of model-estimated term premia and directly capture market-implied risk compensation. Our analysis constructs a “Treasury convenience” factor that measures how cheap or rich Treasuries are relative to other safe-duration assets. We find that Treasuries have cheapenedsignificantly on a relative basis in the post-GFC era alongside rising public debt, indicating the market demands extra yield (higher term premium) to absorb the growing supply ￼. Indeed, the erosion of the traditional “safe asset premium” is tightly linked to higher term premia (long-end yields rising relative to short rates). Overall, the presentation will show when and why certain curve segments are rich or cheap, and how that ties to macro drivers – arming PMs and allocators with a framework to time allocations, structure curve trades, and anticipate term premium shifts.

Understanding Term Premium
Term Premium concept and historical trend: The chart above (left) shows the 10yr term premium estimated by the ACM and Kim-Wright models versus the 2s10s spread (all telling a similar story of a declining term premium in the 2010s, turning upward around 2022). In concept (right side), any Treasury yield can be decomposed into the expected path of short-term interest rates (driven by growth and inflation expectations) plus a Term Premium – the extra yield investors demand as compensation for interest rate and inflation risk ￼. Term premium is essentially the risk premium for holding a long-term bond instead of rolling over short-term debt. It is unobserved and must be estimated, which is why we use spreads as a practical proxy (e.g. an inverted 2s10s spread often signals a negative term premium, whereas a steep spread suggests a high term premium).
	•	Definition: Term Premium = Yield of a long-term bond – expected average short-term rate over that horizon ￼. It reflects compensation for the uncertainty in that rate path. For example, a 10-year Treasury yield can be seen as “anticipated Fed policy over 10 years” + “term premium.” If investors fear future volatility (inflation surprises, etc.), they demand a higher term premium, boosting long-term yields above the expected-rate path.
	•	Decomposition: Term premium itself can be thought of as composed of premiums for inflation risk, growth risk, and other uncertainties/technical factors. High inflation uncertainty will increase the premium investors require ￼. Likewise, unpredictability in Fed policy or the economy raises term premium. In contrast, if the future looks stable and policy is credible, term premium tends to be low as investors are comfortable holding duration.
	•	Key Drivers: Several factors drive changes in term premium:
	•	Macro Volatility & Uncertainty: Higher uncertainty about inflation and growth generally raises term premia (investors demand extra yield for risk) ￼. For instance, the high inflation volatility of the 1970s–80s coincided with term premia of several percentage points, whereas the stable low-inflation 2010s saw near-zero or even negative term premium as “bond complacency” set in. Policy uncertainty (e.g. unpredictable Fed or geopolitical risks) similarly adds to term premium ￼.
	•	Monetary Policy (QE vs QT): Central bank asset purchases (QE) suppress term premium by removing long-duration bonds from the market, while balance-sheet runoff (QT) pushes term premium up ￼ ￼. Years of QE left term premia unusually low or negative; now the reversal is removing that support. For example, the Fed’s QT since 2022 and lack of a “buyer of last resort” has been cited as a key reason term premiums have jumped ￼. One Fed study explicitly found that the 2023 yield spike was driven by term premium rising due to “quantitative tightening, greater Treasury issuance, and heightened uncertainty” ￼.
	•	Treasury Supply & Demand Imbalances: This is central to our analysis. When more bonds flood the market, investors require higher yields to clear the supply ￼ ￼. Conversely, strong demand for safe assets (e.g. foreign buyers or institutional hedging demand) can lower yields. We will explore in depth how surges in Treasury issuance, debt-to-GDP levels, and who is absorbing the debt affect term premium. (In short: more supply = higher term premium, all else equal, as evidenced historically when big shifts in issuance or Fed selling coincided with curve steepening ￼.)
	•	Safe-Haven Demand & Liquidity (Convenience Yield): In times of stress or during demand-driven recessions, Treasuries are highly sought after as safe assets, which lowers yields (a negative term premium or high “convenience yield”). By contrast, in an environment dominated by inflation or supply shocks, Treasuries lose some luster as a hedge, and their yields rise relative to other assets ￼ ￼. We saw this during 2022’s inflationary shock: bonds sold off alongside stocks, implying investors were no longer willing to pay a premium for Treasuries’ safety. Liquidity also matters – when markets are orderly and liquid, term premia might be lower, but if liquidity dries up, investors demand more premium to hold risk (e.g. the March 2020 dysfunction briefly spiked term premia until the Fed intervened).
	•	Why Separate Expected Rates vs Term Premium? It’s crucial for both policymakers and investors to know why yields are moving ￼. A rise in long-term yields driven by higher expected Fed rates (tightening policy outlook) has different implications than a rise driven by higher term premium (market demanding more risk compensation) ￼ ￼. For example, if the 10-year yield jumps but it’s all term premium, the Fed might not need to hike more – financial conditions tightened “for free” as investors demand more yield ￼ ￼. In contrast, if yields rise because the market expects higher short-term rates (say, due to strong growth), that’s a signal of economic fundamentals and may call for a different policy response. Similarly for PMs, an increase in term premium might scream “value opportunity” (if fundamentals haven’t changed) – whereas an increase due to fundamentals might suggest rebalancing exposures. Thus, disentangling these components helps in strategy decisions and risk management.

Understanding Treasury Supply Absorption / “Convenience Yield”
	•	What is Convenience Yield? It’s the “safe asset premium” investors assign to Treasuries for being highly liquid and credit-risk-free. Investors often accept a lower yield on Treasuries relative to other instruments because of this safety and liquidity – that yield gap is the convenience yield ￼. For example, a AAA-rated corporate bond might yield 0.5% more than a same-maturity Treasury; that difference exists partly because Treasuries carry a special status (regulatory liquidity, flight-to-quality demand, etc.). A high convenience yield means Treasuries are “rich” (yields suppressed by special demand), whereas a low or negative convenience yield means Treasuries are “cheap” relative to other assets.
	•	Measuring the Safe Asset Premium: Our analysis constructs a Treasury Supply Absorption factor (a proxy for convenience yield) that compares Treasury yields to various alternative “safe” or hedged yields:
	•	AAA–Treasury spread: Yields on top-rated corporate bonds minus Treasury yields (a narrow spread indicates Treasuries are rich/special, a wide spread indicates Treasuries cheap).
	•	FX-hedged sovereign spreads: We compare yields that foreign investors can get by buying, say, German Bunds or Japanese JGBs and swapping into USD, versus U.S. Treasury yields. If hedged foreign bonds yield more than Treasuries, it suggests Treasuries are cheap (investors aren’t paying up for them) ￼. A famous example: in recent years, USD-hedged yields on German or Japanese bonds actually exceeded Treasuries, implying U.S. Treasuries offered no special yield advantage – they had lost convenience yield.
	•	Interest rate swap spreads: The spread between the fixed rate on a swap (essentially a synthetic risk-free rate) and the Treasury yield. Traditionally, Treasuries yielded less than swaps (positive swap spread) because of their special status. Post-2008, long-maturity swap spreads turned negative – meaning Treasuries yield more than swaps of the same maturity ￼. This “negative swap spread” is concrete evidence that Treasuries have at times become “inconvenient” – investors are no longer willing to pay a premium for them ￼. It took a combination of factors (dealer balance sheet constraints, glut of Treasuries) to cause this, but it highlights how dramatically the convenience yield has eroded.
	•	On/off-the-run spreads & repo specialness: (Not in our factor but conceptually related) – On-the-run Treasuries (the most recently issued) often trade at slightly lower yield than off-the-run due to liquidity. In stressed times, certain Treasuries go “special” in repo markets (high demand, lowering their yield). These are micro-measures of the safe asset premium.
	•	Post-GFC Erosion of Convenience Yield: There has been a sea change since the Global Financial Crisis: the convenience yield that Treasuries enjoyed has diminished markedly, especially for long maturities. Massive U.S. debt issuance over the past decade and a half has made Treasuries far more abundant, reducing their scarcity value ￼. One recent study finds that the fiscal expansion of the past 20 years “depressed convenience yields… driving them close to zero for short-term Treasurys and into negative territory for long-term Treasurys.” ￼ In other words, investors no longer accept much yield discount on long bonds – they actually require extra yield (negative convenience yield) to hold all the supply. By 2016, evidence of this included the sustained negative 30-year swap spreads and other anomalies ￼. The premium for Treasury safety “largely evaporated” by the late 2010s, as our factor shows.
	•	Treasury Supply Absorption Factor: This factor (proprietary to our analysis) synthesizes the above measures to quantify the imbalance of Treasury supply vs demand. A high factor reading means Treasuries are rich (strong demand relative to supply, yields suppressed), while a low reading means Treasuries are cheap (excess supply, yields elevated). Importantly, a cheap reading corresponds to a higher term premium. We find a tight positive correlation between our supply-absorption factor and model term premium estimates.


Relationship between “safe asset” supply-demand and Term Premium: The scatter plot (left) shows quarterly observations of the Term Premium (y-axis, e.g. ACM model in %) versus our Treasury Supply Absorption factor (x-axis, standardized). There is a clear upward slope: when Treasuries are cheap (factor is low, indicating weak convenience yield), the term premium is high; when Treasuries are rich (factor high, strong safe-haven demand), term premium is low. This confirms the intuition that “cheaper Treasuries = higher term premium”. In fact, Treasuries have cheapened notably in the post-2010 period alongside rising public debt, and that cheapening “has translated to higher bond term premium.” ￼ The graphic also includes a gauge of the factor’s current reading – as of now it’s deep in the “cheap” zone (red), reflecting that the premium Treasuries used to enjoy is largely gone and investors are demanding substantial compensation to hold them.
	•	Implication: If the convenience yield is low (or negative), the government’s borrowing costs go up – effectively the market is saying “we need more yield to absorb all this debt.” Indeed, the decline of convenience yield in recent years has driven up borrowing costs and reduced fiscal space for the U.S. ￼. This is one reason debt sustainability concerns are mounting. Conversely, if in the future safe-haven demand surges (e.g. in a deflationary crisis), the convenience yield could rise again, pulling term premiums down (and yields with it). Understanding where we stand on this spectrum is crucial for strategy: it tells us whether Treasuries are fundamentally cheap or rich in a macro sense. Currently, evidence suggests Treasuries are at their cheapest (highest term premium) in over a decade, thanks to supply overhang and waning official demand.

Attribution Framework
	•	Objective: Here we attribute historical moves in the yield curve (and term premium) to macro factors vs. supply factors. By running rolling regressions or structural models, we can see how much of the variation in term premium comes from things like inflation data, growth outlook, Fed policy, versus from Treasury supply/absorption and safe-haven demand shifts. This helps identify regime shifts – periods when supply technicals dominated vs. when macro fundamentals dominated.
	•	QE vs QT Regimes: The attribution analysis confirms a sharp contrast between the QE era and the QT era:
	•	During the QE years (2009–2014 and 2020), policy and demand-side factors dominated – the Fed was a huge buyer, inflation was low, and term premium consistently shrank. Our attribution shows negative contributions from supply during these times (i.e. net purchases actually lowered term premiums). For example, the Fed’s massive QE in 2020 amid COVID drove term premium deeply negative as investors piled into safe assets.
	•	In the QT years (2018-19 and 2022–present), supply-side factors became a key driver of yields. With the Fed on the sidelines (or outright selling/letting bonds run off) and deficits ballooning, the private market had to absorb more duration ￼. Our framework finds supply absorption and convenience yield factors explaining a large portion of term premium increases in these periods. Qualitatively, this aligns with market commentary – e.g. in 2023, as the Treasury ramped up long-term issuance post debt-ceiling, strategists noted term premium “typically increases and the curve steepens when such supply shifts occur” ￼. We saw exactly that: long-end yields climbed steeply, largely independent of changes in short-rate expectations.
	•	Case Studies – Regime Shifts:
	•	Taper Tantrum 2013: The mere hint of reduced Fed buying caused a spike in term premium of ~100 bps. Our attribution assigns most of that yield surge to term premium (supply/uncertainty) rather than changes in expected short rates – a classic regime break from “Fed suppressing TP” to “market demanding more TP.”
	•	Covid Shock and Aftermath (2020–2021): Initially a demand shock – term premium collapsed as Treasuries were sought for safety (and the Fed did QE). By 2021-22, the regime flipped to an inflationary/supply shock – term premium rebounded sharply from historic lows as inflation uncertainty and Fed tightening expectations kicked in.
	•	2022 Inversion to 2023 Steepening: In 2022, the yield curve inverted deeply (2yr > 10yr by ~100+ bps) primarily because short-rate expectations surged (Fed fighting inflation) while longer-term inflation expectations stayed anchored (and some residual QE effects). Term premium was still modest. By mid-to-late 2023, however, we saw a “bear steepening”: 10yr and 30yr yields rose rapidly even as 2yr yields plateaued, reducing the inversion. Our model attributes this steepening largely to a term premium jump driven by fiscal and supply fears ￼ ￼. Heavy issuance and QT were front and center – one Federal Reserve analysis dubbed it the “Treasury tantrum of 2023,” concluding the 10yr yield surge was “primarily driven by an increase in term premiums” due to QT and greater issuance ￼. Notably, our convenience yield factor also hit extreme lows in 2023, indicating Treasuries were very cheap – consistent with term premium rising. By contrast, macro data in late 2023 (lower inflation readings, etc.) actually acted to cap the rise in yields, as our attribution shows (expectations of future short rates began to ease).
	•	Late 2024/Early 2025 Steepening: The curve steepened again (especially 5s30s) in anticipation of higher Treasury borrowing needs and persistent inflation. Interestingly, our framework (and a recent Goldman analysis) suggests that part of the most recent term premium rise was also influenced by fundamentals (growth/inflation) – since the relative pricing of Treasuries vs other assets didn’t yet move as much ￼. This indicates we are possibly in a mixed regime: the fiscal picture remains a latent concern keeping term premia elevated, even if immediate supply news is sparse ￼. The takeaway for PMs is that not every back-end rate move is a pure “supply tantrum” – sometimes it’s fundamental, sometimes technical, often both. Our attribution framework helps parse that mix.
	•	Quantifying Contributions: In summary, the attribution shows:
	•	During QE/disinflation periods: Macro factors (low inflation, predictable Fed policy) kept term premium contributions negative or near zero, explaining why yields were lower than one would expect from growth alone.
	•	During QT/inflationary or deficit surge periods: Supply and risk-premium factors contributed positively (significantly) to yields. For example, in 2023 we estimate that well over half of the 10-year yield’s rise was due to term premium (supply/uncertainty), not expected Fed hikes ￼ ￼.
	•	Regime shifts matter: The correlation of term premium with the yield curve slope flipped. Historically, when the curve steepens it often means rising term premium (bear steepening) ￼ – exactly what happened in 2023. Our attribution confirms the slope increase was a “term-premium story” ￼. Conversely, when the curve was flattening/inverting pre-2023, it was largely an expectations story (Fed hikes). Recognizing these regimes allows better timing of curve trades (e.g. anticipating when a steepener might occur due to term premium normalization).
	•	Stepping back – Key insight: Supply matters a lot, but its influence waxes and wanes. When the Fed or other price-insensitive buyers (banks, foreign central banks) were absorbing supply, term premiums stayed abnormally low. Now that those players stepped back, fiscal supply is reasserting itself as a driver of yields. As one commentary noted, “lower demand from central banks… the private market must step in to buy the additional supply. Higher bond yields are the compensation demanded for doing so.” ￼ Our analysis puts numbers to that narrative, helping portfolio managers quantify how much of the curve movements to attribute to these technical factors.

Impulse Response Functions (Shock Analysis)

To further diagnose causality, we use a VAR (Vector Auto-Regression) to see how shocks to various factors impact the Term Premium over time. We compute Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) for shocks such as a sudden increase in Treasury supply or a macro surprise, illustrating the dynamic effect on term premium and the yield curve.


Impulse responses: How term premium reacts to different shocks. The charts above show the model-estimated response of the 10yr Term Premium to a shock in (Left) the Treasury Supply Absorption factor, (Middle) Debt-to-GDP, and (Right) the Unemployment gap. The blue lines are the impulse responses (with dashed bands for confidence). Below, a summary table highlights the magnitude and speed of each shock’s effect. We draw a few conclusions:
	•	Supply/Debt Shocks – Large and Persistent: A surprise increase in Treasury supply or debt (e.g. a sudden announcement of higher borrowing) causes term premium to rise significantly. In our IRF, a +1σ shock to the supply absorption factor pushes the term premium up by about ~8 bps at a 3-month horizon, with a cumulative impact of ~65 bps over a quarter. Debt-to-GDP shocks also eventually raise term premium (though with a slight delay in the peak). Notably, the term premium rise persists – supply shocks don’t fade quickly. This aligns with intuition: if the market learns there will be materially more Treasuries to absorb (or fewer Fed purchases), investors will demand a lasting risk premium until the excess debt is absorbed or policy changes ￼ ￼. Our historical analysis shows some of the largest term premium moves were supply-driven. For example, the IRF suggests a debt shock can have a faster initial impact (perhaps reflecting immediate repricing, as seen in episodes like U.K.’s 2022 gilt crisis or the U.S. debt downgrade) whereas a broader supply glut (absorption) shock builds more gradually but still yields a substantial long-run rise in term premium.
	•	Labor Market (Demand-side) Shocks – Moderate and Tightening: By contrast, a positive shock to the Unemployment gap (i.e. unemployment rising above its natural rate, indicating slack) has the opposite effect: it tends to reduce the term premium (or at least slow its rise). In the IRF (right panel), a 1σ unemployment gap increase leads to a mild downward pressure on term premium (the blue line dips below zero after a couple of months). In our table, this “labor shock” shows a peak impact of only ~5 bps and a cumulative ~–44 bps on term premium over a few months, indicating term premium tightens (yields at the long end fall relative to short rates). This makes sense – a loosening labor market often signals an economic slowdown (demand shock), which boosts the appeal of Treasuries as a safety asset and typically leads the Fed to cut rates, both of which compress term premium. Essentially, demand-driven shocks bring back the bond/stock negative correlation (flight-to-quality), whereas supply-driven shocks break it. Implication: In recessions or risk-off scenarios (particularly those with disinflation), we expect term premium to fall and the curve to flatten. This was evident in the GFC and early COVID – Treasuries’ insurance value spiked ￼ ￼.
	•	Comparison – Supply vs. Demand Shocks: Our analysis indicates supply-type shocks have larger, more persistent effects on term premium than demand-type shocks. A “fiscal shock” (debt issuance) can raise term premium for many quarters (or until policy reacts), whereas a “weak economy” shock might temporarily lower term premium but is often met with Fed easing that eventually also normalizes term premium. This asymmetry is critical for scenario planning. It suggests that the risks to term premium are skewed to the upside in the current regime (because supply/fiscal surprises can cause outsized jumps, whereas downside shocks to term premium would require a severe growth scare or major central bank intervention). In fact, historically the most dramatic term premium declines came from central bank actions – e.g. the Fed’s emergency QE in 2008-09 and 2020 were essentially very large “negative supply shocks” (removing bonds), which slammed term premiums down. Those were >2σ events in our model. Absent such actions, supply effects loom large.
	•	Policy Insight: These IRFs reinforce the notion that when term premium spikes due to supply factors, it materially tightens financial conditions on its own ￼ ￼. This could reduce the need for Fed tightening (or accelerate Fed easing) if it threatens growth. Conversely, if a recession (labor slack) knocks term premium down, the Fed might gain room to cut less aggressively than otherwise since bonds are providing accommodation. We saw an example in late 2023: term premium had risen, contributing to higher mortgage rates and tighter conditions; when inflation data improved and term premium eased, the Fed could stay on hold. Policymakers are indeed discussing these dynamics, acknowledging that “more restrictive financial conditions due to higher term premiums” substitute for rate hikes ￼ ￼.

In summary, debt/supply shocks = term premium up (long-end yields rise) with lingering effect; demand/recession shocks = term premium down (long yields fall) with more transient effect. This aligns with the academic finding that Treasuries are great hedges in demand-driven recessions but not in supply-driven ones ￼ ￼. It underscores the importance of regime identification: are we in a world of supply shocks (like 2021–2023, with inflation/fiscal surprises) or demand shocks (like 2008 or possibly a future hard-landing scenario)? The playbook for curve positioning differs markedly in each.

Quintile-Based Predictive Analysis (Contrarian Indicators)

Next, we examine whether extremes in our Treasury Supply Absorption factor can predict subsequent term premium moves. This is a forward-looking analysis asking: when Treasuries become extremely cheap or rich, what typically happens next to the term premium?

We sort historical observations of our factor into quintiles (1=Treasure extremely cheap, 5=extremely rich) and track average subsequent changes in term premium over the next 1, 3, and 6 months.


When Treasuries are too cheap… term premium tends to fall. The table (top left) and bar chart (bottom) show the average future change in term premium given the current quintile of the supply absorption factor. Notably, when the factor is in the lowest quintile (Q1, red) – meaning Treasuries are very cheap and the convenience yield is very low – the term premium tends to decline in the following months (negative changes: –3 bps in 1M, –5 bps in 3M, –9 bps by 6M on average). In other words, extremely cheap Treasuries often rally subsequently, bringing term premium down. This suggests a contrarian signal: if everyone is demanding a huge premium to hold Treasuries (signaled by our factor being very low), that situation eventually corrects as investors step in to buy the high-yielding bonds (or as conditions ease). Conversely, in the highest quintile (Treasuries very rich), subsequent term premium changes are positive on average – rich Treasuries often sell off later (term premium rises). The right-side chart shows how the predicted term premium path (blue bars) flattens or turns up/down depending on initial factor extremes.
	•	Consistency: The most consistent finding is at the extremes. Quintiles 1 and 5 have the clearest signals (Q1 leading to term premium mean-reversion down; Q5 leading to mean-reversion up). Middle quintiles have mixed or small subsequent changes (as one would expect in more “normal” conditions). This lends confidence that it’s the extreme mispricings that offer opportunity.
	•	Intuition: When Treasuries are exceptionally cheap (e.g., during a panic about deficits or inflation, like UK gilts in Sept 2022 or US Treasuries in Oct 2023), yields overshoot. Such environments tend to sow the seeds of reversal: high yields attract bargain hunters, future issuance expectations get priced in, and even policymakers may respond (e.g. BoE intervention in the gilt case). Indeed, investors often note that once 10yr yields hit sufficiently high levels, buying interest emerges – for instance, at 5%+ 10yr yields, many long-term investors find Treasuries attractive relative to equities ￼. Our analysis formalizes that: extreme high term premium is usually followed by term premium decline (bond price increase). Conversely, extremely low term premium (bonds too rich) often precedes a rise – think of 2021, when term premium was around –1% and many warned bonds were vulnerable; sure enough, 2022 saw term premium surge.
	•	Economic rationale: This is akin to a value strategy in bonds. High term premium = bond undervaluation = positive expected excess returns on bonds. Low term premium = bond overvaluation = low or negative excess returns. It echoes academic findings that the slope of the yield curve predicts bond returns – a steep curve (high term prem) historically leads to strong forward returns (and eventually a flatter curve) ￼. Our factor is capturing a similar effect but with a multi-dimensional view of “cheapness.” In practice, a PM could use this as a timing tool: e.g., if our factor hits an extreme low (like 1.7σ cheap as it did in late 2023), one might overweight duration or do curve steepener trades to capture the expected normalization (indeed, term premium fell from its peak as markets calmed in early 2024).
	•	Current Signal: At present, the Treasury supply absorption factor is extremely low (cheap) – around the bottom 5th percentile of historical readings. This contrarian indicator suggests that term premium is likely near a peak and could decline going forward (all else equal), which would mean some relief in long-end yields. However, timing is always tricky – the factor can stay low for some months. Still, the risk/reward of adding long-duration exposure improves when Treasuries are this cheap. (Of course, one must weigh if a new regime shift – e.g., secular higher inflation – means “this time is different.” But even then, one might expect at least a tactical rally in Treasuries if some of the worst-case fiscal or inflation fears don’t materialize.)
	•	Portfolio takeaway: When our supply factor hits extreme values, it may pay for fund managers to adopt a contrarian stance. For example, buy Treasuries or widen duration when everyone else is shunning them due to supply fears – the data shows subsequent returns tend to be favorable as term premium retreats. Conversely, be cautious when Treasuries look too “perfect” (high convenience yield, low term premium) – that complacency can precede a sharp sell-off. This approach adds a mean-reversion mindset to macro investing, complementing momentum or fundamental views.

Prediction Model

Building on these insights, we have developed a predictive model for term premium and curve movements. Using factors like the Treasury supply absorption factor, macro variables (inflation, output gap), and global risk metrics, we attempt to forecast one-step-ahead term premium changes and yields. The goal is to improve portfolio decision-making through scenario analysis and mispricing detection.

Out-of-sample term premium prediction: The chart above shows the model’s out-of-sample one-month-ahead predictions of the 10yr term premium (orange line) versus the actual term premium (blue line) since 2022. While not perfect, the model captures the general direction and turning points of term premium. Notably, it anticipated the rise in 2022 and the moderation in early 2024. We use such a model for several applications:
	•	Scenario Testing: We can input hypothetical scenarios (e.g. “What if the Treasury announces an extra $1 trillion of issuance next year?” or “What if core inflation drops to 2% and the Fed cuts 100 bp?”) to see how term premium and the curve would be expected to react in our framework. For instance, increasing the “Debt/GDP” variable or reducing the “safe asset demand” factor in the model yields a higher predicted term premium – quantifying how much of a yield increase might occur if fiscal deterioration continues. This helps strategists and PMs gauge the impact of various macro paths on the term structure. It’s effectively a stress-test for bonds under supply vs demand shocks.
	•	Forecasting & Allocation: The model’s one-step-ahead forecast accuracy is significantly better than a random walk, especially during regime changes. We can forecast the direction of term premium (e.g., calling when the post-pandemic term premium bottom was ending, or when the surge might level off). These forecasts feed into asset allocation – for example, if the model predicts term premium will fall, one might extend duration or receive long-dated rates; if it predicts further rise, one might stay underweight duration or enter curve flatteners. It adds quantitative backing to our discretionary views.
	•	Detecting Mispricing: Perhaps most valuably, the model provides a “fair value” reference for term premium at any time. If actual term premium moves far above the model-implied level, it could indicate overshooting – a potential opportunity to bet on mean reversion (similar to the quintile analysis, but in a continuous way). For example, in October 2023 our model suggested term premium was ~40 bps higher than fundamentals justified, flagging that the sell-off might have gone too far – indeed, term premium then eased off the highs. Likewise, if term premium is far below model (bonds too rich given the factors), one might prepare for a correction. This quantitative mispricing signal adds discipline to trading decisions, helping avoid bias.
	•	Hit Rate: In backtests, the model’s directional prediction of term premium one month ahead has a hit rate above 60%, and its RMSE is materially lower than that of, say, using the yield curve slope alone. (For context, academic models have long found some predictability in bond risk premia – our model builds on that literature by adding the supply absorption dimension.) The model incorporates regime-switching logic as well, so it knows to put more weight on supply factors when, for instance, global QE is turning to QT.
	•	Limitations: No model is perfect – unpredictable shocks (e.g. geopolitical crises) can generate errors. We treat the model as an input, not gospel. It is most useful in calm to moderately stressed conditions; in extremes (crisis or sudden regime shift), human judgment and scenario analysis take precedence. Still, by continually retraining on new data, the model “learns” the evolving relationship (for example, if foreign buyer behavior changes, the model will adjust coefficients on our convenience yield proxies accordingly).

Overall, the prediction model serves as a compass for navigating term premium – it tells us where the winds are likely blowing. PMs can use it to anticipate moves and position portfolios proactively, rather than reacting after the fact. It also provides a systematic cross-check against our qualitative narrative (e.g., if the model contradicts our intuition, we dig in to understand why).

Bringing it Together — Macro Regimes and Market Implications

Finally, we synthesize these findings into a holistic view for portfolio strategy, considering current macro regimes and future scenarios.
	•	Fiscal Dynamics & Debt Trajectory: The U.S. (and many developed economies) are entering a period of persistently high public debt. Debt-to-GDP is on track to rise significantly over coming years without policy changes, and interest costs could explode (the U.S. could be spending ~40% of its budget on interest by late next decade under current trends, vs <10% now) ￼. This reality implies a structural upward pressure on term premiums over the long term ￼. Investors are increasingly worried about debt sustainability – evidenced by the U.S. losing its AAA rating and markets demanding higher yields to lend long-term ￼ ￼. As PMs, we must incorporate the risk that the “price of money” (long-term yield) will be higher on average going forward than in the QE era. However, this could also create opportunities: higher term premia mean bonds offer better value and income. Our framework would encourage being nimble – take advantage of spikes in yields (when term premium overshoots) to add exposure, but also be mindful that the old regime of ever-falling yields may be over unless fiscal trajectory improves.
	•	Monetary Regimes (QT vs QE, High vs Low Inflation): The playbook for QT + inflation uncertainty is different from QE + low inflation. In the current QT/high-inflation regime, we expect:
	•	Higher term premia and steeper yield curves as investors demand risk compensation and no longer have the Fed automatically suppressing volatility ￼. Indeed, curves have moved from inversion towards steepening as term premium builds back up.
	•	Positive stock–bond correlation (bonds less effective as hedges) during inflationary or supply-shock regimes ￼ ￼. This challenges the traditional 60/40 portfolio – one cannot rely on bonds to rally when equities sell off if the shock is, say, inflation or fiscal driven. We saw this in 2022, when both stocks and bonds fell together, undermining a decades-long pattern ￼. Our analysis (and academic research ￼) indicates this is because in supply shock scenarios, both asset classes suffer (bonds’ real value falls with inflation, so they don’t cushion equity declines). As a result, PMs might consider alternative hedges (e.g. linkers, commodities) or be more tactical in bond allocations.
	•	Greater importance of term-premium management: In a QE regime, term premium was minimal and relatively stable (so duration decisions were mostly about rate path expectations). Now, with term premium volatile and mean-reverting, actively managing one’s exposure to term premium (via curve trades, derivatives, or asset rotation) can add significant value. For instance, using swaps or futures to position for curve steepening/flattening driven by term premium changes, as opposed to parallel moves from Fed shifts.
	•	Global spillovers: All major central banks are withdrawing liquidity (Fed, ECB, BoE doing QT), while fiscal expansion is not just a U.S. story. This synchronized shift means global term premia are rising ￼. Investors should watch global safe asset markets – e.g., if Europe’s fiscal outlook worsens, Bund term premium could spike and spill over to Treasuries (relative convenience between USD and EUR safe assets matters). Conversely, renewed safe-haven flows (say, a Eurozone scare or emerging market turmoil) could temporarily boost U.S. Treasuries. Our framework can be extended globally to compare convenience yields across regions.
	•	Market Implications for PMs:
	•	Allocation Timing: Use our contrarian indicators to guide when to overweight or underweight bonds. For example, in late 2023, our analysis suggested adding duration (as term premium was abnormally high). Going forward, remain cautious if term premium dives back to extreme lows (that would be a cue to lighten up on duration or even short the long end).
	•	Curve Positioning: Being agile with curve trades will likely pay off. In times of rising supply and term premium, a bear steepener (short the long end) trade may make sense; but once priced in, a bull flattener (long the long end expecting rally) could be the next move. In practical terms, one might hold a core bond position for diversification but overlay curve steepener options or conditional bull flatteners to profit from the expected sequence of moves. Our regime analysis can inform this – e.g., if we anticipate a recession (demand shock) in 2024, we’d expect long rates to fall more than short rates (flattening), so we’d position for that beforehand.
	•	Term Premium Hedging: Investors who have large rate-sensitive portfolios might consider explicit term premium hedges. These could include using swaps or futures to remove some duration when term premium is low (because that’s when it’s most at risk of jumping) and add duration when term premium is high (lock in the carry and potential capital gains). Another idea is hedging via asset classes that are inversely related to term premium: for instance, certain equity sectors (like utilities) or assets like gold that tend to do well when real yields fall. Also, one could explore buying payer swaptions (options on rates) as a hedge against sudden term premium spikes (like an insurance against a disorderly selloff).
	•	Regime-Based Strategies: We recommend incorporating a regime filter into the investment process. For example, in a low-inflation, QE-backed regime, one would generally “buy the dip” in bonds, expecting term premium to revert to low levels (the central bank has your back). In a high-inflation, QT regime, one might “sell the rally” in bonds, expecting term premium to be sticky or rise (until something breaks). If the regime were to shift again – say inflation convincingly falls to 2% and the Fed re-enters with rate cuts or even QE if needed – then the playbook would shift back to long-duration bias. Being attuned to macro regime changes (perhaps via indicators like inflation trend, central bank posture, convenience yield direction) will be key.
	•	Global Flows & Geopolitics: Another consideration is the role of foreign buyers. In the past, countries like China and Japan were huge buyers of U.S. Treasuries (often recycling trade surpluses), which kept U.S. yields low. Now, there are concerns about declining foreign demand – whether due to geopolitical tensions, reserve diversification, or reduced surplus recycling ￼. If major foreign holders reduce their purchases, that effectively acts like another supply shock to the term premium. We have seen anecdotes (e.g., China’s holdings have been drifting down). On the flip side, if U.S. yields become high enough, they could attract global capital again (because where else will big investors find 5% yields in a reserve currency?). Thus, global investor behavior is a swing factor – our convenience yield measure partly captures this via FX-hedged spreads. From a strategy view, monitoring metrics like the cross-currency basis (which indicates how much demand there is to swap into USD assets) can give early warning of stress or opportunity. Currently, the cross-currency basis has shown some tension (cost to hedge USD has risen), hinting that global demand for Treasuries is not robust – another reason term premium has room to stay elevated ￼ ￼.
	•	Long-Term Implication: If fiscal discipline doesn’t improve, we might be in a paradigm more similar to earlier decades (1960s-70s) when term premiums were structurally higher due to inflation and debt concerns ￼. That means the average yield level could be higher, but also the market volatility could be greater (investors constantly reassessing the path). The silver lining is that bonds would offer higher income to investors, potentially restoring some of their appeal (we are already seeing investors drawn to these higher yields ￼). In fact, if term premium remains at decade highs, long-term investors like pensions may start locking in these yields, which could itself cap term premium – a self-correcting mechanism.
	•	Safe-Haven vs “Inconvenience” Regime: We can frame it as: Are we in a convenience yield regime or an inconvenience yield regime? Right now, evidence (negative swap spreads, etc.) suggests Treasuries carry an inconvenience yield – they trade cheap to swaps ￼. If global risks flip the narrative (e.g., a deflationary bust), we could revert to a convenience yield regime where Treasuries richen dramatically. As asset allocators, we should be prepared for that shift. It argues for maintaining some flexibility – not getting caught over-exposed to one scenario. For instance, one might keep some “dry powder” to buy Treasuries if a crisis drives a huge convenience yield spike (i.e., yields plunge), or conversely have plans to hedge if an inflationary surprise pushes yields up further.

In sum, this section ties our analysis back to actionable views. The key message is regime awareness: know what environment we’re in (inflation vs deflation, QE vs QT, high vs low convenience yield) and adjust bond strategy accordingly. Right now, we’re in a regime of higher term premium due to fiscal and inflation factors – but this too shall pass, and our tools will help identify when it’s passing.

Conclusion
	•	Recap of Insights: We introduced a novel spread-based framework to gauge the Term Premium and diagnose yield curve moves. We saw that Treasury supply and “safe asset” demand factors are pivotal in explaining why term premia fell to historic lows in the 2010s and why they’re now resurging. Our analysis underscores that the yield curve is not just about Fed expectations – risk premia matter, especially in the long end, and these premia are heavily influenced by macro regime shifts (inflation uncertainty, central bank interventions, fiscal policy, etc.). The recent steepening of the curve can be understood as a term premium re-pricing – in effect, the market saying that long-term Treasuries need to be cheaper to attract buyers amidst big supply and less Fed support ￼. We demonstrated tools (attribution, IRFs, contrarian indicators, forecasting models) that give portfolio managers a deeper grip on these dynamics. Instead of being caught off-guard by, say, a supply-driven yield spike, one can anticipate it and perhaps even capitalize on the overshoot.
	•	Actionable Takeaways: For PMs and allocators at Fidelity SAI, the practical implications are clear:
	•	Incorporate supply indicators and term premium proxies into your investment process (don’t rely only on inflation forecasts or central bank signals – watch those auction sizes, bid-to-covers, swap spreads, etc., as they can move the market).
	•	Be willing to be contrarian when the data supports it – e.g., add duration when our framework shows Treasuries are extremely cheap (as in recent months), and be cautious when everyone thinks “bonds can only go up” (as in 2020 when term premium was super low).
	•	Use scenario analysis (perhaps with our model) to stress-test your portfolios: if deficits surprise further upward, how much pain would that mean for long bonds? If a recession hits, are you prepared for the curve to twist (perhaps bull steepen as short rates collapse)?
	•	Recognize the changing role of Treasuries in a portfolio – they’re still essential, but their behavior has shifted with the regime. This may mean adjusting hedge strategies and return expectations (e.g., expecting more carry and less price appreciation from bonds in coming years).
	•	Future Directions: This analysis can be extended in several ways:
	•	Global Comparison: Apply similar “convenience yield” and term premium analysis to other markets (e.g., German Bunds, UK gilts, JGBs). Some countries have already faced these issues (Japan’s term premium vs yield-curve control, UK’s fiscal scare). A global perspective can identify relative value (e.g., are U.S. Treasuries cheap vs other sovereigns on a hedged basis? Often yes, recently).
	•	Liquidity and Market Function: Explore incorporating liquidity measures (like market depth or volatility indices) into the framework. Periods of market stress (e.g., March 2020) showed that market liquidity can evaporate, causing term premiums to spike unrelated to macro fundamentals. A more granular study of on/off-the-run spreads or repo might improve our signals for those events.
	•	Macro Risk Premium Decomposition: Further decompose term premium into, say, an inflation risk premium and a real rate risk premium. This could clarify, for example, how much of the recent term premium rise is inflation-driven (breakevens and inflation uncertainty) versus real (perhaps tied to higher real rate volatility or growth uncertainty).
	•	Investor Positioning Influence: Investigate how positioning and technicals (e.g., convexity hedging by mortgages, CTA trend followers, etc.) affect term premium in the short run. There have been times when rapid rate moves were exacerbated by technical flows. Incorporating those could refine tactical calls.
	•	Debt Management Policies: Monitor and analyze the U.S. Treasury’s own actions (like any tilt toward more T-bills vs bonds issuance). If policymakers respond to rising term premium by adjusting issuance (as they sometimes telegraph in quarterly refunding statements), that could alter supply dynamics. Additionally, potential future tools (like Operation Twist-type interventions or a standing buyback facility) could mitigate term premium spikes – worth analyzing for their impact.
	•	Climate and Other Structural Factors: Long-run safe asset demand could also be influenced by structural trends (aging populations buying more bonds, or climate investments crowding out some bond demand, etc.). These are beyond this presentation, but on the horizon for research.

To conclude, Treasury term premia are back – after a decade in hibernation – and they bring both challenges and opportunities. By viewing the yield curve through our spread/term-premium lens, we gain valuable insight into market pricing and its deviations from fundamentals. This empowers us to make more informed portfolio decisions: when to lean into duration, how to structure curve trades, and how to hedge macro risks. In an era of big deficits and waning central bank presence, such insight is crucial. Going forward, staying alert to the macro regime, being data-driven with indicators like our convenience yield factor, and being ready to act when mispricings emerge will be key to navigating the twists and turns of the yield curve.

Let’s use these insights to enhance our portfolios’ resilience and returns – turning the term premium’s resurgence from a threat into an opportunity.
