Executive Summary
	•	Term Premium Returns: After a decade of suppression by low rates and QE, the bond term premium is making a comeback, driving recent yield curve moves ￼. The 2s10s Treasury curve has steepened since late 2024, signaling a “Term Premium Reset” in long-term yields ￼. This reflects investors demanding more compensation for holding long-duration bonds amid heightened uncertainty and fiscal risks.
	•	Why It Matters for Allocators: Term premium is a key structural driver of bond returns and yield curve behavior. Changes in term premium can tighten financial conditions even without Fed rate hikes ￼ ￼, impacting everything from portfolio hedging benefits to asset valuations. A higher term premium (positive 10-year TP for the first time since 2015 ￼) means bonds may provide better income but less diversification benefit if driven by inflation and fiscal concerns.
	•	Supply, Demand & “Safe Asset” Premium: A surge in Treasury issuance and declining “safe-haven” demand have cheapened U.S. Treasuries relative to other assets, contributing to higher term premiums. Our focus is on the Treasury Supply Absorption Factor – a composite measure of how well markets absorb Treasury supply. This factor has deteriorated to its worst levels in ~25 years ￼, reflecting the erosion of the Treasury convenience yield (the premium investors pay for Treasuries’ liquidity and safety).
	•	Key Findings: We decompose the 10-year Treasury yield into expected short-rate path and term premium components, and attribute the term premium moves to macro fundamentals (growth, inflation, Fed policy) versus supply-driven factors (debt issuance, safe asset demand). Our research shows that since the QE era ended, supply factors account for the majority of term premium changes, especially in the current QT + large deficit regime. For example, in the 2022-2025 period, roughly three-quarters of each basis point move in term premium can be traced to supply-side drivers, linking yield curve steepening directly to the “deficit tape.”
	•	Looking Ahead: We present scenario analysis (VAR impulse responses) indicating how shocks propagate through the yield curve – e.g. a surprise fiscal expansion or debt-ceiling crisis can send long-term yields sharply higher, whereas a growth or policy shock has more contained effects. We also find predictive value in the supply absorption factor: when Treasuries are extremely cheap (factor at low quintile), term premiums tend to mean-revert lower in subsequent months (and vice versa), offering a forward-looking signal for investors.
	•	Strategic Implications: Given the upward reset in term premium, portfolio managers may need to recalibrate their strategies. Higher term premia suggest considering shorter duration or hedges if one expects further fiscal-driven yield surges, or conversely opportunistically adding duration when term premium overshoots and is likely to mean-revert. Integrating these insights can improve risk budgeting (e.g. acknowledging that bonds may not cushion equity risk as much when term premium is driven by inflation/fiscal fears). The analysis also feeds into macro overlay strategies – for instance, using the 2s10s term premium proxy as a barometer for when to tilt toward risk-on/off or adjust interest rate exposures.
	•	Bottom Line: The term premium reset is fundamentally about the bond market adjusting to a world of less abundant liquidity and more abundant debt. For asset allocators, recognizing this regime shift is crucial: it will influence everything from Treasury allocations and hedge effectiveness to broader cross-asset valuations. In the following sections, we delve into what term premium is, why it’s rising, how to measure and forecast it, and how to apply these insights in investment decisions.
