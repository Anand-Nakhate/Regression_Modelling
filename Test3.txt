What is the Term Premium? In essence, a bond’s yield consists of two parts: (1) the expected path of short-term interest rates over the bond’s life, and (2) an extra term premium. The term premium is the additional yield investors demand for the risk of holding a long-term bond instead of rolling short-term debt ￼. It compensates for uncertainties – such as future rate volatility, inflation surprises, or shifts in investor risk appetite – that could arise during the bond’s term ￼ ￼. In other words, it’s like an insurance premium for interest-rate risk and other imponderables over the long horizon.
	•	Decomposing the Yield: If we imagine the 10-year Treasury yield, part of it reflects where markets expect the Fed’s overnight rate to average over the next 10 years (fed funds path influenced by growth and inflation outlook). Anything above that expected path is the term premium. For example, if investors think short rates will average ~3% but the 10-year yields 4%, the ~1% gap is term premium – compensation for locking money in longer-term. In times of high uncertainty or risk aversion, investors demand a larger term premium (raising long yields). In calmer times or when safe assets are in high demand, term premiums can shrink or even turn negative (meaning investors are willing to pay for the safety/liquidity of long bonds, accepting yields below future short-rate expectations).
	•	Historical Perspective: Term premia have not been static – they’ve gone through regimes. Historically, term premiums were significantly positive (several percentage points) in periods of higher inflation volatility (e.g. the 1970s-80s). In the post-2008 era, however, aggressive monetary policy and excess savings crushed term premiums. The Federal Reserve’s QE programs “all but eradicated” the term premium after the Global Financial Crisis, as the Fed’s bond-buying removed a lot of duration risk from markets ￼. By the mid-2010s, some model estimates even showed slightly negative term premium – a rare environment where investors were effectively paying a premium for the privilege of holding ultra-safe, long-term Treasuries. For instance, the New York Fed’s ACM model and the Kim-Wright model both indicated sub-zero 10yr term premia for much of the late 2010s and during the 2020 pandemic crisis (see chart above).
	•	The Recent Reset: Fast forward to 2023-2025, and the situation has flipped. As inflation surged and the Fed hiked rates, long-term yields rose sharply – not just due to higher expected short rates, but also a return of term premium. By late 2023, the 10-year term premium (by NY Fed’s estimate) climbed by over 1 percentage point from its pandemic lows, crossing above zero to its highest levels since 2015 ￼. This reflects investors’ recognition that holding long bonds now carries more risk (inflation uncertainty, fiscal uncertainty) than in the ultra-stable low-rate decade prior. The yield curve (2s10s), which had been deeply inverted on expectations of Fed easing, also began to steepen as longer rates rose faster than short rates – a sign that term premium was driving the move ￼ ￼. In fact, various models of term premium spiked to cycle highs in late 2023, highlighting that the market was starting to price in fiscal and inflation-related risks into long-term yields ￼.
	•	Relevance to Fund-of-Funds and Allocation: Why should asset allocators care about term premium? Because it changes the game for bond investing and diversification. When term premium is very low or negative, long-term bonds tend to offer lower forward returns and primarily reflect expectations of rate cuts (often making them good hedges in a downturn). When term premium is rising or high, long bonds offer higher carry but also are more vulnerable to losses independent of Fed policy moves. A rising term premium can lead to concurrent declines in both stocks and bonds, as seen in 2022, reducing the typical negative correlation that many multi-asset portfolios rely on. Indeed, the Fed noted that a sudden normalization of term premium towards more typical levels is a risk that can lift long-term yields and depress asset prices broadly ￼. Thus, understanding and monitoring term premium helps allocators judge the risk/reward of holding duration and adjust strategic exposures (e.g. deciding when to go overweight Treasuries for protection or underweight them to avoid term-premium-driven losses). We’ll explore these applications further in later sections.

2s10s as a Proxy: Throughout this presentation, we will sometimes use the 2-year vs 10-year Treasury yield spread (2s10s) as a rough proxy for term premium. Why? The 2-year yield largely reflects near-term Fed policy expectations, whereas the 10-year yield includes those same expectations plus the term premium. So changes in the 2s10s slope – especially when driven by rising long yields with stable short yields – can indicate changes in term premium. For example, the sharp steepening from an inverted curve (with 2s10s around -100 bps) toward a flatter curve in late 2024 suggests an upward repricing of term premium ￼ ￼. This is not a perfect measure (policy expectations also evolve), but it’s intuitive for investment teams to monitor as an on-the-go indicator. Indeed, our chart earlier overlaid 2s10s with formal term premium estimates and showed they often move in tandem over time. We’ll now dive deeper into the drivers of term premium – in particular, the role of Treasury supply and the convenience yield, which are central to the “Term Premium Reset” theme.

Treasury Convenience Yield and the “Safe Asset” Premium

At the heart of the structural term premium story is the concept of the Treasury convenience yield – essentially, the extra value or “yield discount” that investors assign to U.S. Treasuries because of their unparalleled safety and liquidity. Treasuries are not just debt instruments; they are the world’s benchmark safe asset (used as collateral, held by central banks, etc.). Investors at times accept a lower yield on Treasuries compared to less-liquid but otherwise similar instruments, effectively paying a premium for the convenience of holding Treasuries. This foregone yield is the convenience yield (or safe asset premium).
	•	Defining Convenience Yield: One way to think of it is to compare Treasuries to interest-rate swaps or highly rated corporate bonds. A positive convenience yield means Treasuries yield less than these alternatives, indicating investors are willing to give up yield for Treasuries’ safety and liquidity ￼. For example, if 10-year swap rates (which are like synthetic Treasuries without needing to hold the bonds) are 4.5% but 10-year Treasuries yield 4.3%, that 0.2% gap is a convenience yield – the market’s implicit “safe asset premium” for Treasuries. Key drivers of this yield gap include the demand for safe collateral, regulatory requirements forcing banks to hold high-quality bonds, and global demand from investors seeking dollar safety.
	•	Treasury Richness vs Cheapness: Market participants often describe Treasuries as “rich” when their yields are low relative to fundamentals or substitutes (high convenience yield), and “cheap” when their yields are high relative to comparable rates (low or negative convenience yield). These rich/cheap conditions fluctuate. During crises or periods of high risk aversion (e.g. 2008, 2020), Treasuries tend to trade rich – everyone piles into the safest asset, driving yields down more than policy expectations alone would justify. Conversely, if there’s a glut of Treasuries relative to demand (for instance, heavy issuance without commensurate buying), Treasuries can turn cheap, with investors demanding a higher yield to hold the surplus supply.
	•	Rising Debt and Erosion of Convenience Yield: Over the past decade, a structural shift has occurred: the U.S. government’s debt expanded massively, especially post-GFC and again during the COVID fiscal response. Public debt held by investors (ex-Fed) as a share of GDP has roughly doubled from pre-2008 levels, flooding markets with safe assets. This abundance of Treasuries has steadily eroded their scarcity value. In other words, the convenience yield has fallen as the marginal benefit of holding yet another trillion in Treasuries diminishes ￼. Empirical evidence backs this: academic studies find that when the supply of government debt is lower, long-term yields tend to be lower (higher convenience premium), and vice versa ￼ ￼. One notable study estimated that a 1 percentage point decrease in the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio (especially if it’s long-maturity debt) can lower long-term Treasury yields by as much as ~40 basis points ￼ – a powerful supply effect on pricing. With debt moving in the opposite direction (debt-to-GDP climbing higher each year), it’s reasonable that investors now demand additional yield to absorb this supply.
